Questions: "1) What is recurrent viral meningitis?\nRecurrent viral meningitis is
  meningitis that occurs more than once due to a viral infection.  The current known
  causes of recurrent viral meningitis are herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), herpes
  simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and epstein-barr virus (HHV-4). \nDefinition according
  to the US Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center for recurrent viral meningitis
  (Mollaret’s meningitis): “Mollaret meningitis is a rare type of viral meningitis
  that is characterized by repeated episodes of fever, stiff neck (meningismus), muscle
  aches, and severe headaches separated by weeks or months of no symptoms. About half
  of affected individuals may also experience long-term abnormalities of the nervous
  system that come and go, such as seizures, double vision, abnormal reflexes, some
  paralysis of a cranial nerve(paresis), hallucinations, or coma. Mollaret meningitis
  is poorly understood and the exact cause remains unknown. However, recent data suggests
  that herpes simplex virus (HSV-2 and, less frequently, HSV-1) may cause some, if
  not most cases. Other causes may include trauma and viral infections other than
  herpes simplex. There is no specific treatment, so management involves supportive
  measures such as rest, fluids, and medicine to relieve the fever or headache.”\n\n2)
  What are the symptoms of recurrent viral meningitis?\t\t\t\t\nSymptoms of a full-blown
  recurrent viral meningitis infection include:\nsevere headaches\nfever (only seen
  in about half of cases)\nnausea\nvomiting\nsensitivity to light and/or sound\nmalaise\nneck
  rigidity\nRarer symptoms include:\ntachycardia\ndouble vision\nhallucinations\nBecause
  of the similarity in symptoms to benign migraine headache, sufferers of recurrent
  viral meningitis have often been misdiagnosed by medical personnel. Without proper
  care, symptoms can escalate to seizures and even coma. Thus, a greater understanding
  and knowledge of this disease will facilitate better patient care in emergency situations.\nPeriods
  of severe illness usually last 3-4 days, separated by weeks or months between recurrences.
  However, many sufferers experience milder relapses, which although debilitating,
  do not necessitate hospitalization.\nUnfortunately, along with each recurrence,
  whether mild or severe, comes the risk of further disability. Nearly half of those
  with the disease experience long-term negative effects of the nervous system. Permanent
  disabilities that can develop over time include:\nmemory loss\ndifficulty retaining
  information\nlack of concentration\nabnormal reflexes\nclumsiness\ncoordination
  problems\nloss of balance\nresidual headaches\nhearing problems\ntinnitus\nspeech
  problems\ndizziness\nlearning difficulties (ranging from temporary learning deficiencies
  all the way to long term mental impairment)\ntachycardia\nepilepsy\nseizures\nparalysis\nmuscle
  spasms\ncerebral palsy\nloss of sight\nchanges in sight\n\n3) How is recurrent viral
  meningitis diagnosed?\nRecurrent viral meningitis can be diagnosed through lumbar
  puncture (spinal tap) in order to examine the cerebrospinal fluid (the clear, colorless
  liquid that fills and surrounds the brain and the spinal cord and provides a mechanical
  barrier against shock). Diagnosis is made by detecting Herpes simplex virus DNA
  in the cerebrospinal fluid. Early diagnosis may prevent prolonged hospital admissions,
  unnecessary investigations, and exposure to unnecessary medications, along with
  their associated costs. If a patient has had a recent head injury or a problem with
  their immune system, they may not qualify for a lumbar puncture because of a possible
  fatal brain herniation; therefore, a CT or MRI scan may be performed prior to any
  lumbar puncture. All of the different types of meningitis (viral, bacterial, fungal
  and parasitic) are diagnosed by the growing presence of bacteria in the spinal fluid,
  a sample of which is collected with the help of a lumbar puncture. The fluid will
  reveal if the CSF (cerebral spinal fluid) has raised or lowered white blood cell
  production.\nThere are no vaccines currently available to prevent the development
  of viral meningitis. Many people who have a rare disease understandably want to
  find healthcare professionals or researchers with knowledge of their condition.
  However, with a condition as rare as recurrent viral meningitis, it can be extremely
  difficult to find medical professionals who have treated more than one or two cases.\n\n4)
  How is recurrent viral meningitis treated?\nCurrently, Acyclovir is the treatment
  of choice for recurrent viral meningitis. Acyclovir has proven helpful in many cases,
  particularly when administered intravenously, where it can cross the blood/brain
  barrier. It is often the immediate treatment of choice for recurrences that require
  hospitalization. Some have also seen a reduction in recurrences from daily oral
  administration of Acyclovir, but it hasn’t been shown to definitively alter the
  recurrence of viral meningitis.\nValcyclovir is another medication similar to Acyclovir
  that has also been found helpful. Other common medications also administered for
  the subsequent pain during recurrences include:\nNSAIDS (Motrin, Advil)\nHydrocodone
  (Norco, Vicodin Lortab)\nmorphine\nhydromorphone (Dilaudid).\nAnti-seizure medications:\nGabapentin
  (Neurontin)\nPregabalin (Lyrica)\nLamotrigine (Lamictal)\nWith recurrent viral meningitis,
  it is difficult to measure the effectiveness of any drug therapy because the very
  nature of the disease is spontaneous and recurrent. The rarity of the disease also
  makes it difficult to create solid documentation of clinical trials studying the
  effectiveness of different antiviral drugs. However, there are some medications
  known to be contraindicated for the treatment of recurrent viral meningitis, those
  include:\nphenylbutazonum\nsteroids\nantihistamines\ncolchicine\nestrogen.\nFor
  those that have obtained an allergy to Acyclovir, and other antivirals, Lysine seems
  to be effective at helping to minimize symptoms according to patients."
What should I know about lumbar punctures?: "1) What is a lumbar puncture?\nLumbar
  puncture is a diagnostic procedure, also known as a spinal tap, where a doctor samples
  fluid from the spinal column without putting any medication in.\nLumbar puncture
  is different from what is commonly known as an epidural, where an anesthesia doctor
  puts medication into the spine for child birth or surgical anesthesia.\n\n2) What
  are the indications for a lumbar puncture?\nTo make a diagnosis of a potentially
  life threatening neurologic or infectious disease.  The only way to perform analysis
  safely of the spinal fluid is by lumbar puncture in that case.  It’s routinely required
  to perform a lumbar puncture, especially in cases of suspected infection of the
  brain or spinal cord known as meningitis or encephalitis.\n\n3) What is the difference
  between Meningitis and Encephalitis?\nMeningitis is an infection of the lining of
  the spine and the brain, whereas encephalitis is infection of the brain itself.
  \ Both can be diagnosed by lumbar puncture.\n\n4) What is involved in a lumbar puncture
  procedure?\nA needle enters the lower back through the skin, and soft tissue, and
  then the needle enters the spinal column to sample out the spinal fluid.\n \n5)
  Is the lumbar puncture procedure safe?\nThe lumbar puncture procedure is very safe
  and has very few potential side effects.\n \n6) What are the risks of lumbar puncture?\nThe
  main risk of lumbar puncture is pain at the site.  The pain at the site can be minimized
  using numbing medicine, such as lidocaine which often stings itself.  \nAnother
  relatively common effect of lumbar puncture, with sample removal, is a post lumbar
  puncture headache where the patient up to five days out from a lumbar puncture can
  experience a certain type of headache characterized by pain at the top of the head,
  or back, that is positional.  It is better lying down and worse when seated up,
  or standing, or walking around. That is reported in up to 30% of patients undergoing
  lumbar puncture and is usually a treatable complication with either medication or
  another procedure called a blood patch where the patient’s own blood is put into
  the lower back to treat the post lumbar puncture headache.\nOther very rare complication
  of a lumbar puncture include a formation of a collection of blood or hematoma inside
  the spinal column, which can be diagnosed and treated.  It is greatly reduced by
  being aware of patients bleeding tendencies and also medications that might be able
  to be held for the lumbar puncture that could increase the risk of bleeding during
  the procedure or afterwards.\n**You will need to speak with your doctor about the
  risks and benefits of the procedure in your specific case.**\n \n7) Can there be
  neurologic symptoms, or neurologic injury, from a lumbar puncture?\nIt is thought
  to be very rare that a permanent neurologic injury could occur from lumbar puncture.
  \ When we do the lumbar puncture procedure we enter below the level of the spinal
  cord, and the spinal cord is most important in terms of avoiding neurologic injuries.
  \ So we go below the spinal cord.\nThere are nerve roots inside and outside the
  spine that maybe come apparent during the procedure.  Sometimes when the needle
  enters the space where the fluid is, a patient can experience a lightning bolt sensation
  down their leg.  That usually goes away almost immediately and if it doesn’t go
  away immediately, it certainly goes away at the end of the procedure.  It is very
  unusual to have a persistent symptom like that after the procedure is completed.\n
  \n8) Other things to consider regarding lumbar punctures.\nWe reduce the risk of
  infection, or causing an infection, by using sterile techniques.\nA mask for the
  operator\nCleansing the skin\nUsing a sterile field when performing a lumbar puncture.\n
  \n9) Lumbar puncture information specific to those with recurrent viral meningitis.\nMollaret’s
  meningitis is a recurrent type of meningitis and the only way to diagnose meningitis,
  inflammation of the lining of the spinal cord, is by lumbar puncture looking for
  inflammation there.  That requires sampling of the fluid. There is no known risks
  of repeat lumbar puncture beyond the risks of the lumbar puncture already addressed
  for each time the procedure is performed.\n**We recommend talking to your doctor
  about the specifics of your case.**"
